        <p>As a new learner of both HTML and WordPress, I feel as though each platform had distinct challenges. With HTML, I quite literally had the power to do whatever I pleased with my site, and that amount of power was overwhelming to start. With WordPress, after becoming used to HTML, its interface seemed quite limiting and at times frustrating, to say the least. Generally, I enjoyed the process quite more with HTML, simply because there were more learning resources available to me, which made the development process a pinch smoother than the WordPress alternative. However, I can see how the WordPress site would be easier to keep up with updates and used as a blog platform would be more suitable than an HTML site. In some instances, my HTML site gave me difficulty formatting certain elements, but it was nothing I wasnâ€™t able to resolve. WordPress was different on this front, I wanted to manipulate my gallery element to act a certain way, but there was little information about the subject online, so I left it as originally formatted. I personally feel that a decent amount of creativity is needed to make an HTML site look presentable because anyone can present a site with no CSS and the information needed but it takes an artistic eye to make it a pleasant web experience. WordPress on the other hand gives the user a fairly simple way to manipulate the experience, but few distinct options to customize beyond the themes. However, the experience updating the site and posting new content was significantly more intuitive than HTML and I can understand why many individuals would use WordPress rather than creating their own site. On this site, I wish to learn how to better manipulate div elements and using spacing and other CSS elements to customize the appearance of my page.</p>
