            <h2>Game Analysis</h2>
            <ul class="roman">
                <li>Look and listen in the game: What features (or assets) are helping to create an illusion of exploring a world? How simple or complex are the graphics and media?
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>The graphics are very simple as far as modern games go, but I think that helps add to the persona and feeling of the game. The music is soothing rather than heavy, which is typical for other "cozy" games being made today.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How simple or complex are the settings in the game? How far can you explore and what makes the settings distinctive?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>The gameplay is simple at its core, you complete tasks and buy things and read letters. From what I played there is one explorable area, but it's implied that there are other areas that you do not have access to.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What kind(s) of character(s) are you invited to control? Are you invited to be multiple characters? Or just one character type?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>There is only one playable character and it is the old woman of the former town.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How do you get to know the character(s) you are playing? What details make them distinctive, quirky, memorable, etc?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>There is a short introduction to our playable character at the beginning of the game, but most of her character is learned through the way people who left the town saw her, and how they describe her in their letters.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What kinds of interactions do you have with NPC characters?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>I hear things from my loved ones through the form of letters and I can interact with a traveling salesman to purchase goats and hay and receive my mail.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>How are you challenged as a game player in this game? What are you being asked to investigate, where do you get stuck, and how do you make progress in the game?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>I got stuck right at the beginning actually when I was told to pick up the watering can. The can wasn't very distinct and I didn't find the object I needed to interact with until about day 2 or 3.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What kinds of objects do you interact with in the game? Do you pick up written messages, do you ever need to consume food in the game, do you pick up functional things you need to get other things work?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>You can interact with the watering can, the basket, the milk pail, the chicken coop, the milk churn, your house, the goat(s), the traveling salesman, and the well. You can pick up letters from the salesman and read them after you select them from your inventory. The main character does not need to eat, but the goats do eat hay. Some options must be selected in a certain order, for example, you must have milk before you can churn it into cheese, or you must have water in the watering can before you can water your plants.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Where (if ever) do you see the game comment on itself in a meta way as a fictional, constructed system (as a game)?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>I don't see this game being meta or breaking the fourth wall at all. I don't see that as relevant to the plot or gameplay of the game.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Where and how do you see the game respond to or comment on our reality? Or what cultural issues from our world do you see reflected in this game?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>I feel like this game is largely a comment on doing away with the old, but not in a good way. It could also be seen as an abandonment of our older generations as technology adapts, which would be a twisted way to put it since it is a video game of all things.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Speculate: How could this game develop in the future, or what would be an improvement the developers could make in a next stage?
                    
                    <ul class="square">
                        <li>I feel like the objects in the world could be more defined and instead of being thrown right into it without knowing where objects were and how to interact with them, there could be a tutorial.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Corpus Analysis</h2>
            I am taking Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre and comparing it to Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights. I have chosen these pieces since I have extensive research on Jane Eyre and minimal research on Wuthering Heights and wish to learn how the two compare. My goal is to see the difference in styles between these sisters.
            
            <img src="JaneEyre.jpg" alt="Jane Eyre">
            <img src="WutheringHeights.jpg" alt="Wuthering Heights">
                
            <h3>Mr.</h3>
            
            After an initial analysis, the biggest word that stuck out to me from both texts was Mr. . Based on the context I know from Jane Eyre, I can infer that most of the “Mr.”s are referring to Jane’s boss/lover Mr. Rochester. In Wuthering Heights, I have less background with the work so using context clues I believe it refers to Mr. Heathcliff. Upon examining their characters, I find it interesting how differently Charlotte and Emily write their male characters.
            
            <h3>Jane and Catherine</h3>
            
            I found it interesting that Jane and Catherine were repeated the same amount of times in their respective works. The reason I find it interesting is because Jane Eyre is significantly longer than Wuthering Heights, which means to me that Catherine either plays a larger role than Jane in her respective story, or there are less characters in Wuthering Heights therefore Catherine gets more screen time.
            
            <h3>Said</h3>
            
            The word “said” is repeated quite a bit in both of these works, which makes sense neither of them are biographies or cookbooks. But it was the context of these words and their frequency and location that I was concerned with. In Jane Eyre, said was repeated more in the middle of the story before a steep drop off, whereas in Wuthering Heights its usage steadily increased until the end of the work.
            
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            
            After reviewing both of these works, I’ve better learned how these two Brontë sisters structure and style their works and how their characters mesh in their respective stories. Both of the sisters are feminists in their own respect given the time, but I feel that Emily is more progressive than Charlotte especially in the roles she gives her female characters. This was single handedly my favorite part of the reflection process, and if I had to do it again, I would include works from their third sister, Anne.
